The inspiration from this project came from a YouTube video I watched on a Tableau Portfolio Project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKAarfLRQ&ab_channel=MoChen). The project uses the reviews on British Airways from the website Skytrax. I found the dataset he used on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dharun4772/british-airline-review-dataset/data) but I wanted to try to code it out myself. I will then create my own review visualization tool on Tableau.

A bit of background on myself, I am making a transition into the data analytics/data science industry. The [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/prestonc0903/cathaypacific_tableau/blob/main/Skytrax_Webscrapping_CathayPacific.ipynb) will show my workflow on how I performed the webscrapping, starting from a extracting a single component of a review, to writing the individual for loops, combining all the loops together, and finally writing the code to make it possible to extract the reviews for any airline on Skytrax.
