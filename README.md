# Cathay Pacific Airline Review Tool
**Data visualization project that utilizes Python to extract airline review data and Tableau to create a simple visualiztion.** <br>

**Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas) | Tableau** <br>

The inspiration from this project came from a similar [Tableau Portfolio Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlAKAarfLRQ&ab_channel=MoChen). The original project uses the reviews on British Airways from the Skytrax website available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dharun4772/british-airline-review-dataset/data). Rather than use the same dataset, I decided to extract the review data from another airlines, Cathay Pacific.The [Skytrax_Webscrapping_CathayPacific](https://github.com/prestonc0903/cathaypacific_tableau/blob/main/Skytrax_Webscrapping_CathayPacific.ipynb) notebook will show my workflow on how I performed the webscrapping, starting from a extracting a single component of a review, to writing the individual for loops, and finally combining all the loops then exporting the data. After creating the visualition, I did a very simple data clean up which can be viewed in the [CathayPacific_DataCleanup](https://github.com/prestonc0903/cathaypacific_tableau/blob/main/CathayPacific_DataCleanup.ipynb) notebook. Finally, I built and published a tool to view the airline review data. <br>
All of the code and exported data are available in this repository. As a disclaimer, I am still fairly new to coding, data analytics, and data science and would appreciate any form of feedback.
